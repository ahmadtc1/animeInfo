### What Is It?
AnimeInfo is a beautifully designed **responsive web application** to help you find out all about your favorite animes as well as explore new animes. With AnimeInfo you can search animes by name, and genre to discover more information about them, as well as find anime specific streaming links.

### How Was it Developed?
AnimeInfo is a **Python Flask** web application that uses Flask for backend logic and **Jinja2** for a beautiful dynamic frontend. The [Jikan API]([https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#)) was consumed at different endpoints to obtain information about the user's desired anime depending on their search method and target. The streaming link for each anime was calculated using a **personally developed algorithm** for users to be able to access anime streams in a hassle-free way.
